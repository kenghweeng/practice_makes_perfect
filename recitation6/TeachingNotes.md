Rough Teaching Notes:
1. Introduce common `list` operations. Remind them to use for PE and put in cheatsheet.
2. Talk about time complexities of the common `list` operations. Refer them to: https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity
3. `list.copy`
* The why?
* What does shallow even mean?

4. Expose them to sorting algos, refer them to https://visualgo.net/en.
* Remind them they need to know about time and space complexities, but no need to know how to implement from scratch.

5. How to use the actual Python `sort` function!
